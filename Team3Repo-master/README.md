## Project Description : 
PWS is a system created for Fresno State students. Students and visitors who are new to
Fresno State campus typically have trouble traversing the campus. This application
looks to provide a simple, yet effective web application that helps guide in finding
walking paths to students and visitors to their requested destinations. Some additional 
notes provided in the system to help the students and visitors choose the
building entrance which is closest to their class or room number. Students, faculty, staff
members and any other user of the system will be able to navigate within the building
itself to a specific room number for enhanced navigation with the help of floor plans
associated with that building.
New users will have an option of creating an account and logging in, or using the website
as a guest. Each user will be able select their current location, or set a pin, as a starting
point. Next, the user will select their destination. This will provide the user with the
fastest route to their destination from the given starting point. The database will
facilitate the user signup, login as well as saving the history of the searched locations or
pinning their favorite locations to their account. The user needs to be connected to the
database without any network issues in order for the login and search history to work.
